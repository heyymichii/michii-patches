# 🧩 Michii Patches

LinkedIn patches for use with [Morphe](https://morphe.software), by **heyymichii**.

Michii Patches is an independent project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or part of the
Morphe project or LinkedIn.

## ❓ About

Michii Patches removes ads and clutter from LinkedIn and adds features the app does not have:

- **Ads & promotions:** hide promoted posts, promoted jobs, suggested posts, sponsored messages,
  and Premium / AI upsells (feed, profiles, Jobs, and the "Me" panel).
- **Download:** a download button on full screen photos, videos, profile photos, and banners,
  with a configurable save location.
- **Feed filters** (off by default): focus mode (hide like/comment/repost counts), celebrations,
  job cards, reposts, video posts, the "New posts" pill, and "See translation".
- **Chat:** ghost mode (no typing indicator or automatic read status; mark chats read by hand
  from the chat list), hide sponsored messages.
- **Privacy:** open links directly without LinkedIn's warning page (including `lnkd.in` short
  links), remove tracking parameters from copied and shared links, and an optional analytics block.
- **Disable double-tap like** on posts and photos.
- **Settings:** turn each feature on or off, search settings, back up and restore them, see which
  patches are applied, and check for updates. The settings are in English, or in Indonesian when
  your phone uses Indonesian (change it under Other → Language).

### Opening the settings

- Tap your profile photo to open the "Me" panel, then **Michii Patches** (below "Saved posts"), or
- long press the LinkedIn app icon on your home screen, then **Michii Patches**.

The app icon shortcut is added the first time LinkedIn opens after patching.

### Supported version

| App | Version |
|---|---|
| LinkedIn (`com.linkedin.android`) | **4.1.1255.1** (APKMirror variant *Android 10+*) |
